# Data Science with SQL and Python for IBM

This project focuses on utilizing SQL and Python for data science tasks within the context of IBM. It aims to demonstrate how SQL and Python can be integrated to analyze and manipulate data, perform statistical analysis, and build predictive models.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for this project:

- sqlalchemy==1.3.9
- ibm_db_sa

8. Determine the community area that is most crime-prone.
9. Find the name of the community area with the highest hardship index using a sub-query.
10. Determine the community area name with the most number of crimes using a sub-query.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook file for the complete code and execution of the SQL queries.
